# CSCI 202 Assignment 5 - People in Space

> Working with data from the [People in Space API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/), create a site that presents this information. The people in space API provides a JSON list of individuals currently in space, including their names, the spacecraft they are on, the total number of people in space. Use this information to create that creatively visualizes this information. I encourage you to think about interesting ways you would like to represent this information.

## Concept
- [Old Space Jam website??](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/)
- Separate display of people on ISS and people on other craft.
- Maybe integrate [ISS location](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) in some way
